## Project Description

A donate-to-earn project that connects communities in need, with people who are interested in donating to a cause.
Allows donors to donate with cryptocurrencies, and rewards top donors with tokens

## Project Value

This app would bridge the gap between funding projects and people looking to help. It would ease the process of donation using cryptocurrency, and would motivate top donors with rewards to keep donating.

Donar is a team project, in the polygon's 2022 hackaton. It was built in a very limited time and we hope that we are given the oppotunity and support to futher this project to a full scale enterprice level DApp.
